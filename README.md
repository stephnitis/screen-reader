# screen-reader

## Author: Stephanie Hill

### About

This is a project dedicated to learning more about technology designed for accessibility.

### Key terms & notes

#### Affordances

- offer or afford a person the opportunity to perform an action
- Offer affordances so non-sighted users can access our content

#### How does Chrome communicate with a screen reader?

- HTML gets parsed by browser and gets turned into the DOM (collection of JS objects)
- DOM gets combined with CSS and gets transfered to the screen
- Chrome makes another tree, the accessibility tree
  - edits out things that aren't important e.g. divs
  - keeps things like text, buttons
  - This is the tree that the screen reader uses, and users rely on
- Programmatic semantics
- Can inspect accessibility tree
- Implicit Semantics: similar to focus, native elements, get rich semantics for free
- Landmarks: screen readers can quickly jump to these sections on the page
- Most people report that when on unfamiliar website, they begin navigating by header in their screenreader
  - This is why it is so important to not skip through from h1 to h4, use them in sequential order, that is how someone using a screenreader forms a mental outline of your page
- web rotor: practice and see how people get around the document
- Generic elements: generic semantics
  - when we use generic elements and style them to act as a button, we mess up the semantics and non sighted users land on that item and cannot recognize that they can take action

#### Focus

- Focus: selecting an element and directing keyboard elements to that selected element
  - critical, how users reach all the interactive controls in our application
  - navigated via tab or tab-shift keys on keyboard
- Tab-order is the order that elements are focused in the document
  - inferred by the DOM ordering of your mark-up
- Not all elements are focusable: non interactive elements
- Best practice is to move elements higher in the DOM if we want them displayed first
- tabindex attribute: specifies the tab order of an element when the tab button is used for navigating
  - can be used on any HTML element
  - `tabindex="0"` item becomes programmatically focusable, thus we could call its focus method and it would direct focus to it, useful to direct a user to a specific control, possibly after they perform a specific action on the page
  - `tabindex="-1"` useful for managing focus, items are not interactive, but are focusable, possibly useful for disabling interactive controls
  - `tabindex="<value > 0>"` element will be jumped ahead of everything else in the tab order: not recommended

#### Roving `tabindex` || Roving Focus

- Treat complex controls, whenever possible, as a single Tab stop, so the user can tab into it use their arrow keys to interact with it if they like, or bypass by hitting tab key again
- Define own HTML elements using the custom elements spec (allows you to create custom tags which inherit from native HTML element)

``` javascript
class RadioButton extends HTMLElement {
  constructor(){
    super();
  }
  // every custom element has a set of lifecycle callbacks that you can hook into to run your own code
  // e.g. connectedCallback gets run every time our element is inserted into the DOM
  // here we are setting up initial state
  connectedCallback(){
    this.setAttribute('role', 'radio');
    this.setAttribute('tabindex', -1);
    this.setAttribute('aria-checked', false);
  }
}
window.customElements.define('radio-button', RadioButton);
```

#### Buttons

- synthetic click activation: If you add a "click" handler to a button, it will run when the user presses ENTER or SPACE
- If clicking on the element will perform an action on the page, use `<button>`.
- If clicking on the element will navigate the user to a new page then use `<a>`. This includes single page web apps that load new content and update the URL using the History API.
- The reason for this is that buttons and links are announced differently by screen readers. Using the correct element helps screen reader users know which outcome to expect.
