## Author: Stephanie Hill

### About

This is a project dedicated to learning more about technology designed for accessibility.

### Key terms

- Focus: selecting an element and directing keyboard elements to that selected element
  - critical, how users reach all the interactive controls in our application
  - navigated via tab or tab-shift keys on keyboard
- Tab-order is the order that elements are focused in the document
  - inferred by the DOM ordering of your mark-up
- Not all elements are focusable: non interactive elements
- Best practice is to move elements higher in the DOM if we want them displayed first
- tabindex attribute: specifies the tab order of an element when the tab button is used for navigating
  - can be used on any HTML element
  - `tabindex="0"` item becomes programmatically focusable, thus we could call its focus method and it would direct focus to it, useful to direct a user to a specific control, possibly after they perform a specific action on the page
  - `tabindex="-1"` useful for managing focus, items are not interactive, but are focusable, possibly useful for disabling interactive controls
  - `tabindex="<value > 0>"` element will be jumped ahead of everything else in the tab order: not recommended
- focus method
